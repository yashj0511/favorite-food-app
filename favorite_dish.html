        <p class="food-description">Pizza is a dish of Italian origin, made with an oven-baked, flat, generally round bread that is often covered with tomatoes or a tomato-based sauce and mozzarella cheese.

        <p class="food-description">A burger is a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Slices of raw onion, lettuce, bacon, mayonnaise, and other ingredients add flavor.  
            Burgers are considered an American food but are popular around the world. In Japan, teriyaki burgers are popular. In India, vegetarian burgers are created using potato and mint instead of a meat patty. </p>

          <p class="food-description">In the United States, potatoes cut into long strips and fried in deep fat have been known as french fried potatoes, then french fries, and now just "fries."

            French fried potatoes are a favorite food in countries around the world. What makes them so popular? Perhaps it is the flavor of the fat, or the salt—or both—that leads us to purchase the potatoes often. French fries do not require eating utensils in informal situations, which makes them easy to eat and to carry away from the point of purchase. The many restaurants selling french fires frequently combine servings of fries with another food, for example, fried fish or hamburgers. Also, these restaurants advertise widely, so we are tempted to buy french fried potatoes repeatedly.</p>

        <div class="food-details">
          <p class="food-description">Noodles are one of the most important traditional staple foods in Asia. Noodles are typically made from unleavened wheat dough and are stretched, extruded, or rolled, and then cut into varying shapes. Noodles account for approximately 20%-50% of the total wheat consumed in Asia, and its popularity has extended to many countries outside of Asia (Hou, 2010a). Noodles can be classified into several types based on different processing technologies, such as fresh raw noodle, dried noodle, parboiled noodle, frozen noodle, steamed noodle, and instant noodle. Fresh raw noodles have moisture content of around 32%-38% and are prepared without drying.</p>
